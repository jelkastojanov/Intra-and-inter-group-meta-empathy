# Intra- and intergroup meta-empathy
This repository is associated with the project 'First and second-order intra- and intergroup empathy' (pre-registered on OSF: https://osf.io/e96k3). The title is provisional.

## Overview

In two studies, the following research questions were examined: (a) how people think that others (ingroup or outgroup members) perceive emotional states of people who either belong or do not belong to their social groups; (b) how people think that others feel after finding out about ingroup or outgroup emotional experiences; and (c) how these second-order judgments compare to people’s first-order emotion perception and affect-sharing. Additionally, people’s judgments were compared directly to the responses reported by members of the ethnic ingroup as well as the ethnic outgroup. As we expected some people to be more biased when inferring the emotional responses of ingroup and/or outgroup members than others, we were also interested in exploring whether the degree of bias could be predicted by individuals’ identification with the ingroup, as well as their prejudice and meta-prejudice. These studies were conducted in the context of Croatia and Serbia, countries previously torn by ethnic conflict where acts of discrimination and intergroup violence frequently occur even today, two decades after the formal resolution of the conflict.
